# QuantEcon-RSE Intensive Course on Computational Modeling

This is the homepage for the 2019 QuantEcon-RSE Intensive Course on
Computational Modeling, jointly organized by the [Research School of
Economics](https://www.rse.anu.edu.au/) (RSE) at ANU, [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) and the Australian Treasury.

The event is sposored by RSE.


## Location and Dates

The course will be held at Australian National University in Canberra.

#### Lectures

* Dates: Monday 16th Dec -- Friday 20th Dec 2019
* Hours: 9am -- 5pm, Monday to Friday
* Lecture Room: [Fred Gruen Seminar Room](https://studentvip.com.au/anu/main/maps/84590), HW Arndt Building, RSE

#### Social events

Day 1 Mon 16 Dec -Social Event on RSE terrace Courtyard 5-7pm:
Day 4 Thurs 19 Dec â€“ Workshop Dinner at Badger and Co

## Equipment

Participants are expected to bring a laptop with the latest version of
[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed.

## Prior to Arrival

Prior to arrival, all participants are expected to read and step through all 6 lectures in the
section [Introduction to Python](https://python.quantecon.org/index_learning_python.html) of the [QuantEcon Python lectures](https://python.quantecon.org).

Please anticipate spending at least one hour per lecture on this task.

All participants are required to sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com/),
since we will be using it to communicate and share code throughout the
workshop.
