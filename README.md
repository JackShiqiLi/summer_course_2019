# QuantEcon-RSE Intensive Course on Computational Modeling

This is the homepage for the 2019 QuantEcon-RSE Intensive Course on
Computational Modeling, jointly organized by the Research School of
Economics (RSE) at ANU, QuantEcon and the Australian Treasury.

The event is sposored by RSE.


## Location and Dates

Dates: Monday 16th Dec -- Friday 20th Dec 2019
Hours: 9am -- 5pm, Monday to Friday
Lecture Room: Room XXXX (TBA), Australian National University

Welcome dinner: XXXX
Social event: XXXX


## Prior to Arrival

You are required to bring a laptop with 
the latest version of [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed.

Prior to arrival, all participants are expected to read and step through all 6 lectures in the
section [Introduction to Python](https://python.quantecon.org/index_learning_python.html) of the [QuantEcon Python lectures](https://python.quantecon.org).

Please anticipate spending at least one hour per lecture on this task.

All participants are required to sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com/), since we will be using it
to communicate and share code throughout the workshop.
